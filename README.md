# Keyboard Trackpad

## Overview 

This script turns your keyboard into a trackpad, so you slide your finger over the keys to move the cursor. It also supports multi-touch, which maps to a scroll function. There is no practical reasoning behind this project at all.

It uses a physics-based acceleration system to try predict where your finger actually is, since the locations of the keys themselves are not representative of the user intent. It does a decent job in my opinion.
